<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Matt George. I am a husband, father, software developer, fly fisher, and lawn mower.</p>

<p>I bend python to my will as part of my job and enjoy bourbon on the weekends. Occasionally I resist the urge to over engineer and let myself remember that DRY and design patterns are suggestions, not rules. I am lucky enough to have taken a hobby and made a career.</p>
