title: Getting Started, Again.
---
When I started thinking about getting my website/blog up and running again I knew I was done with
database driven applications. Not that they are bad, it's just overkill for a simple website/blog.
I probably won't post that often and I am comfortable using git to version my docs. Instead, I went 
looking for a static site generator.

After evaluating several, including Jekyll and Hyde, I decided on blogofile. 
It's pretty simple, extendable, and python based, so yeah that's awesome.
