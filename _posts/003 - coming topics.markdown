Recently I had the experience of utilizing the django-oauth-access library from the team at Eldarion. Unfortunately, the documentation
is practically non-existent. As a result of my experience, I thought that I might share some tips

$$code(lang=python)
import this

if __name__ == "main":
    print "Hello, World!"
$$/code
