title: Talent Incubation
draft: True

Currently Nashville has two startup incubators. That's great, but we are missing one thing. We are on the cusp
of a talent war in nashville. 

1. There are not enough quality engineers in Nashville for the number of companies

2. There are not enough quality companies to attract outside talent.
    - There are many quality companies and they bring in people from outside. However, we do not
      have a reputation as a developer friendly town.
    - Nashville companies do not have any sort of tech reputation.
        (this has to do with companies such as HCA - which hurts the tech reputation, not help)

3. Nashville has the beginnings of some very good tech culture, but it needs to be nurtured

4. The quality of life in Nashville is pretty darn cool
