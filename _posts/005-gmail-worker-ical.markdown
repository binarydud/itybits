title: Co-worker Calendars
---
This afternoon I was trying to setup my work calendars from gmail in ical. The problem I kept
running into was that I wanted to see my coworkers calendars, but didn't want to go to calendars.google.com everytime. These 
are some instructions for how I got it to work for me (I'm assuming that you've already setup your google calendar to sync with ical via CalDAV):

1. Open up preferences, click on the account in question
<img src="/images/ical_step1.png" alt="step 1" />
2. Click on delegation

3. Check all the boxes of co-worker calendars you want to see.
