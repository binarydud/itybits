thoughts:
1. nashville is currently an IT town
2. we should want nashville to be a tech town
3. we as a community need to encourage and help the innovators, not the status quo
4. the road to hell is paved with good intentions -  i'm looking at the tech "awards" in nashville
5. don't celebrate mediocrity
6. open source is very important, it helps recruit
7. we can't rely on recruiters
    - recruiters don't find top talent
    - executive level finds doesn't help
8. we need to bring engineers in, not just companies (aka the Shareable Ink effect)
9. tone the marketing down. We need a no bullshit environment
10. stop exporting college talent out of town
11. connect college/young/inexperienced with startups/available opportunities.
12. If you don't have an engineer on staff, you will struggle to bring on new talent
13. we need to incubate not just vc funded startups, but also lean and bootstrap startups (looking at your entrecenter)
    - perception is that nashville coddles VC startups (perception among engineers)
14. engagement and cooperation among disciplines.
